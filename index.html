          <h1>About the Narkomfin Building</h1>
          <h2 id="about1">About the project</h2>
          <p>
            The Narkomfin Building is an institutional and research project of
            Garage Museum of Contemporary Art. The Museum team is studying both
            the architectural significance of the building and the life stories
            of its creators and inhabitants over a period of 100 years. The
            knowledge generated will form the basis of tour itineraries,
            publications, and various public and education projects constructed
            around this legendary building. In addition, residents of the
            building, Museum patrons, and GARAGE cardholders have access to
            Narkomfin Café, and a book shop has opened on the first floor of the
            residential block.
          </p>
          <h2 id="about2">History of the building</h2>
          <p class="bold">
            The residential building created for staff of the Ministry of
            Finance of the RSFSR, which is now known as the Narkomfin Building,
            is one of the best-known experimental constructions in the USSR of
            the late 1920s and early 1930s.
          </p>
          <p>
            The history of the building’s construction is closely connected with
            social processes taking place in the first decades of the USSR’s
            existence. Representatives of various professions were tasked with
            educating the new Soviet citizen, who would speak a new language,
            live according to the precepts of communism, and, as a result,
            become a true champion of its ideas. In architecture this led to the
            creation of house-communes and «transitional type» projects such as
            the Narkomfin Building. Laundry, childcare, and even residents’
            leisure activities were all designed to take place in shared spaces
            and meals were to be served in a communal dining room.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, the Narkomfin Building was famous not so much for its
            social concept as its unusual architectural solution.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Narkomfin Building was based on designs for apartments developed
            by staff of the section for typifying residential accommodation of
            the Construction Committee (STROIKOM) of the RSFSR, headed by Moisei
            Ginzburg. The architect Alexander Pasternak, brother of the poet
            Boris Pasternak, became the lead staff member and a close associate
            of Ginzburg. He was the author of a series of projects for living
            cells, as compact apartments designed for various types of family
            were then called.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a result of the section’s work, a decree was issued that
            recommended various versions of living cells for mass construction
            and the rest for experimental buildings. The design provided
            economical but comfortable living accommodation for the time, and
            natural lighting was also preferred.
          </p>
          <p>
            The few remaining design drawings for the Narkomfin Building—working
            drawings and blueprint copies—do not entirely match the building as
            constructed. (In 1934, Ginzburg published the drawings submitted for
            approval and not the final version.) In particular, in some
            apartments additional rooms were created and other elements were
            included that did not feature in the design. However, from the
            beginning the Narkomfin Building consisted of three blocks: the
            housekeeping block, the communal block, and the residential block
            (the unbuilt second project included another housekeeping block and
            a second residential block).
